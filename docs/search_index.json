[["index.html", "Apple Products Analysis Chapter 1 Introduction", " Apple Products Analysis Anshuo Wu, Shengdi Chen 2021-12-02 Chapter 1 Introduction Apple is one of the biggest technology companies in the world today. They have launched various products such as iPhone, iPad, MacBook, and so forth. They provide so many opportunities for the customers by offering a wide range of products. They have come up with everything a person may want and desire. Apple is one of the most valued brand all over the world. The way Apple design their products and the strategies they use to advertise their products contribute to the success of the company. Our final project for EDAV class will employ some data visualization tools to analyze how Apple changes its products over generations. Specifically, we will analyze the change in screen sizes, camera pixels, and battery life, etc. Then based on these changes, we will explore Apple’s financial data to discover any relationship between the change of the products with the company’s sales and revenues. We will also discuss and analyze missing values. In the end, we will compare the characteristics of changes in Apple products with other popular smartphones to learn more about the common changes in smartphones. We aim to discover more about the vast technology market from those common changes. The questions we are interested in studying in this project: By comparing different features, like size, camera pixel, and battery life, of Apple products, especially iPhone, and how fast they were changing during these years, can we infer how customers’ needs had been changed? How did Apple’s financial data change over the years, and how did the change inform us of the financial circumstances of Apple? How did the sales and revenue change and what could cause those changes? Are customers satisfied with those changes? How did they affect customer satisfaction? Are the changes of Apple products specific to Apple itself? Can we see similar changes in other popular smartphones? What can we learn about the technology market from the general changes in all smartphones? "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources Anshuo and Shengdi are both responsible for collecting the data. Our data mainly from Wikipedia. There are many useful and official dataset in Wikipedia. List of iOS and iPadOS devices: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_iOS_and_iPadOS_devices Explanation: This dataset contains a list of Apple’s devices and compares different features of those products. For instance, it compares power, storage, charging rate, and cameras for each Apple device. It can help us to visualize the difference of features among each generation of devices. By looking at the changes among those devices, we can estimate how fast they change in the past years. Comparison of Macintosh Models: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Macintosh_models Explanation: This dataset mainly compares Apple’s Macbooks in different generations. It compares features like storage, memory, and processors in a similar manner as the last dataset. By looking at the changes, we can visualize the rate of change among different generations. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone Explanation: This dataset examines different generations of iPhones in more detail. It particularly includes the launch price for each generation of iPhone. This feature helps examine the relationship between the change of the products with the company’s sales and revenues. Finance Table: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc. Explanation: The above Wikipedia page includes the financial data of Apple from 2000 to 2020. It contains the company’s revenue, net income, total assets, and number of employees across the years. This information helps us to understand Apple’s change of financial circumstances within the last ten years. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Apple_Inc._products Explanation: This dataset includes the timeline of the release of each apple product. It shows the products that Apple continues to innovate and the products that Apple has tried to manufacture. This information helps us examine the motivations behind the change of each Apple product. Comparison of Smartphones: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_smartphones Explanation: This dataset compares different brands of smartphones, including iPhones. It helps us to see the changes in other smartphones, and then relate them to the changes we discover in iPhones. This relationship helps us to answer whether the change of Apple products is unique to itself. If the change can be seen in all smartphones, then we will discover more about the general technology market. Customer Satisfaction Index: https://www.theacsi.org/acsi-benchmarks/benchmarks-by-brand/benchmarks-for-smartphones Explanation: This dataset shows how customers are satisfied with iPhones and smartphones of other brands. We will analyze how customers reacted to the products’ changes over the years.

We will divide them into four different sections and do the data transformation separately. Later, we will use these cleaned data to plot and answer our questions in the introduction. 3.1 iPhone Features Data The dataset of Apple products features is very large, and it contains a lot of information in various aspects. We will mainly focus on certain features (including Release date, Display, Rear Camera) of iPhone for all available models. Firstly, we will merge several tables of different models, and then separate them into smaller tables for different features. For release date table, we added another column to store the date information in the correct format. For the display data table, we will focus on the screen size and the resolution information. We added extra column for screen size in inch, resolution x and resolution y. iPhone Release Date ## Model Released Discontinued ReleaseDate ReleaseYear DisconDate ## Length:33 Length:33 Length:33 Min. :2007-06-29 Length:33 Min. :2008-07-11 ## Class :character Class :character Class :character 1st Qu.:2014-09-19 Class :character 1st Qu.:2016-09-07 ## Mode :character Mode :character Mode :character Median :2017-09-22 Mode :character Median :2019-09-10 ## Mean :2016-11-25 Mean :2018-08-22 ## 3rd Qu.:2020-04-24 3rd Qu.:2021-09-14 ## Max. :2021-09-24 Max. :2021-12-02 iPhone Display table ## Model PixelDensity(ppi) AspectRatio TypicalMaxbrightness( cd⁄m2) Contrastratio(typical) ## Length:23 Length:23 Length:23 Length:23 Length:23 ## Class :character Class :character Class :character Class :character Class :character ## Mode :character Mode :character Mode :character Mode :character Mode :character ## ## ## ## TrueToneDisplay ProMotionDisplay HDR10Content DolbyVision Taptic TypicalMaxbrightness ## Length:23 Length:23 Length:23 Length:23 Length:23 Length:23 ## Class :character Class :character Class :character Class :character Class :character Class :character ## Mode :character Mode :character Mode :character Mode :character Mode :character Mode :character ## ## ## ## ScreenSizeIn ResX ResY ## Min. :4.000 Min. :1136 Min. : 640 ## 1st Qu.:5.420 1st Qu.:1792 1st Qu.: 828 ## Median :5.850 Median :2340 Median :1080 ## Mean :5.667 Mean :2125 Mean :1035 ## 3rd Qu.:6.060 3rd Qu.:2532 3rd Qu.:1170 ## Max. :6.680 Max. :2778 Max. :1284 iPhone Rear Camera table ## Model iPhone 6S iPhone 6S Plus iPhone SE(1st generation) iPhone 7 iPhone 7 Plus ## Length:35 Length:35 Length:35 Length:35 Length:35 Length:35 ## Class :character Class :character Class :character Class :character Class :character Class :character ## Mode :character Mode :character Mode :character Mode :character Mode :character Mode :character ## iPhone 8 iPhone 8 Plus iPhone X iPhone XS iPhone XS Max iPhone XR ## Length:35 Length:35 Length:35 Length:35 Length:35 Length:35 ## Class :character Class :character Class :character Class :character Class :character Class :character ## Mode :character Mode :character Mode :character Mode :character Mode :character Mode :character ## iPhone 11 Pro iPhone 11 Pro Max iPhone 12 Pro iPhone 12 Pro Max iPhone 11 iPhone SE(2nd generation) ## Length:35 Length:35 Length:35 Length:35 Length:35 Length:35 ## Class :character Class :character Class :character Class :character Class :character Class :character ## Mode :character Mode :character Mode :character Mode :character Mode :character Mode :character ## iPhone 12 Mini iPhone 12 iPhone 13 Mini iPhone 13 iPhone 13 Pro iPhone 13 Pro Max ## Length:35 Length:35 Length:35 Length:35 Length:35 Length:35 ## Class :character Class :character Class :character Class :character Class :character Class :character ## Mode :character Mode :character Mode :character Mode :character Mode :character Mode :character iPhone supported months table ## Model Months supported to date ## Length:33 Length:33 ## Class :character Class :character ## Mode :character Mode :character 3.2 Apple Finance Data The finance table includes revenue, net income, total assets, and employees information. However, there are some missing data in the table, so we need to replace the word “N/A” with NA in our dataframe. Also, the value in year column is not in reasonable format, so we also update that. ## Year Revenuein mil. USD Net incomein mil. USD Total assetsin mil.

Missing Values Patterns Plots for Counts Missing Values Patterns Plots for Percent 4.2 Reasoning and Intepretation We want to discover the reason behind the missing values, so we first print out the missing patterns of the finance table. ## Year Revenuein mil.

Since our year column is in chronological order, we know that the five missing rows in Employees column is positively correlated with the year column. Therefore, we want to print out the first five missing rows and the next few employees rows without missing values. By comparing the values of these rows, we may discover the reason behind the missing values in Employees column in the first five years. ## # A tibble: 6 × 5 ## Year `Revenuein mil. USD` `Net incomein mil. USD` `Total assetsin mil. USD` Employees ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 2000 7,983 786 6,803 &lt;NA&gt; ## 2 2001 5,363 −25 6,021 &lt;NA&gt; ## 3 2002 5,742 65 6,298 &lt;NA&gt; ## 4 2003 6,207 69 6,815 &lt;NA&gt; ## 5 2004 8,279 274 8,050 &lt;NA&gt; ## 6 2005 13,931 1,328 11,516 14,800 After we apply the plot_missing function on the finance table from Wikipedia, we find that Apple’s finance table only has two missing patterns, and the missing values are all occurred in the employee’s column. Also, by looking at the top plot of the missing graph, we find out that there are five rows of missing values in the finance table. The year of these missing values is from 2000 to 2004, which is very early, so the employee’s data could be missing. This could be one of the main reasons. From 2004 to 2005, we can see that the change is more significant compared to the changes in previous years. Thus, we think another possible reason could be that from 2000 - 2004, the number of employees does not matter too much; while from 2004-2005, the company’s rapid development, more information is needed. So since then, the number of employees started to be collected.

As an iconic figure among all Apple products, iPhone can be a typical product for our analysis. In this section, we will take deep analysis on the features of different generations of iPhone products, like the release date and discontinued date, display of the phone, and the rear camera mode. In our data cleaning section, we have obtained the data that contain those essential information, and we will utilize these data and a vast of R libraries including tidyverse, rvest, robotstxt, patchwork, naniar, janitor, and vistime to help our exploratory analysis. 5.1.1 Release and Discontinued Date According to the cleaned table of released and discontinued data table, we plot this timeline According to these two plots, we are able to see that Apple gradually introduced more and more products over the year. 5.1.2 iPhone Display Table We have selected some features from the origianl iPhone Display table. Column names explanation??? Ignore the x-axis values. The x-axis value for each point is each iPhone model in the order of release time. (We checked the overlap models, and only keep one of them.) 5.1.3 iPhone Rear Camera Table For iPhone Rear Camera, we mainly care about some features as the following. ## Model Aperture ## 1 iPhone 6S f/2.2 ##
