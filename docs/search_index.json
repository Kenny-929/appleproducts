[["index.html", "Apple Products Analysis Chapter 1 Introduction", " Apple Products Analysis Anshuo Wu, Shengdi Chen 2021-11-13 Chapter 1 Introduction Apple is one of the biggest technology companies in the world today. They have launched various products such as IPhone, IPad, MacBook, and so forth. They provide so many opportunities for the customers by offering a wide range of products. They have come up with everything a person may want and desire. Apple is one of the most valued brand all over the world. The way Apple design their products and the strategies they use to advertise their products contribute to the success of the company. Our final project for EDAV class will employ some data visualization tools to analyze how Apple changes its products over generations. Specifically, we will analyze the change in screen sizes, camera pixels, and battery life, etc. Then based on these changes, we will explore Apple’s financial data to discover any relationship between the change of the products with the company’s sales and revenues. We will also discuss and analyze missing values. In the end, we will compare the characteristics of changes in Apple products with other popular smartphones to learn more about the common changes in smartphones. We aim to discover more about the vast technology market from those common changes. The questions we are interested in studying in this project: By comparing different features, like size, camera pixel, and battery life, of Apple products and how fast they were changing during these years, can we infer how customers’ needs had been changed? How did Apple’s financial data change over the years, and how did the change inform us of the financial circumstances of Apple? How did the sales and revenue change and what could cause those changes? Are the changes of Apple products specific to Apple itself? Can we see similar changes in other popular smartphones? What can we learn about the technology market from the general changes in all smartphones? Are customers satisfied with those changes? How did they affect customer satisfaction? "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources Anshuo and Cyndi are both responsible for collecting the data. Our data mainly from Wikipedia. There are many useful and official dataset in Wikipedia. List of iOS and iPadOS devices: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_iOS_and_iPadOS_devices Explanation: This dataset contains a list of Apple’s devices and compares different features of those products. For instance, it compares power, storage, charging rate, and cameras for each Apple device. It can help us to visualize the difference of features among each generation of devices. By looking at the changes among those devices, we can estimate how fast they change in the past years. Comparison of Macintosh Models: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Macintosh_models Explanation: This dataset mainly compares Apple’s Macbooks in different generations. It compares features like storage, memory, and processors in a similar manner as the last dataset. By looking at the changes, we can visualize the rate of change among different generations. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone Explanation: This dataset examines different generations of iPhones in more detail. It particularly includes the launch price for each generation of iPhone. This feature helps examine the relationship between the change of the products with the company’s sales and revenues. Finance Table: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc. Explanation: The above Wikipedia page includes the financial data of Apple from 2000 to 2020. It contains the company’s revenue, net income, total assets, and number of employees across the years. This information helps us to understand Apple’s change of financial circumstances within the last ten years. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Apple_Inc._products Explanation: This dataset includes the timeline of the release of each apple product. It shows the products that Apple continues to innovate and the products that Apple has tried to manufacture. This information helps us examine the motivations behind the change of each Apple product. Comparison of Smartphones: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_smartphones Explanation: This dataset compares different brands of smartphones, including iPhones. It helps us to see the changes in other smartphones, and then relate them to the changes we discover in iPhones. This relationship helps us to answer whether the change of Apple products is unique to itself. If the change can be seen in all smartphones, then we will discover more about the general technology market. Customer Satisfaction Index: https://www.macrumors.com/2020/05/19/apple-smartphone-customer-satisfaction-index/ https://www.theacsi.org/acsi-benchmarks/benchmarks-by-brand/benchmarks-for-smartphones Explanation: This dataset shows how customers are satisfied with iPhones and smartphones of other brands. We will analyze how customers reacted to the products’ changes over the years.
